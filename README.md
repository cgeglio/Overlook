# Neon Rose Hotel

## About
My assignment was to build a hotel management tool for hotel customers and staff to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. I decided to call my fictional hotel the Neon Rose and I created several neon features throughout the app.

## Setup

- Change into the hotel directory
- Run npm install
- Run npm start
- Login as a manager with username: manager, password: overlook2019
- Login as a customer with username: customer[1-50], password: overlook2019
